Hi, I'm Kevin Mu, and my first rails project is hosted at:
http://protected-bayou-4931.herokuapp.com/

This project was fairly straightforward and simple, and was primarily a matter
of following the instructions given. I ran into a bit of trouble uploading to
Heroku because I forgot to generate a public key, but that was quickly resolved.
Sorry for submitting late, I forgot that it was due already when I went to sleep
last night (thought it was still Sunday)
